## Project Title
**Basic Crowdfunding Platform**

## Project Description
The Basic Crowdfunding Platform allows individuals to fund a specific project by contributing money to a campaign. The campaign owner sets a goal and a duration for the campaign. Contributors can send funds, and if the goal is met by the end of the campaign, the campaign owner receives the funds. If the goal is not met, contributors can claim a refund.

## Project Vision
The vision for this project is to provide a decentralized platform where anyone can create a crowdfunding campaign with the assurance of transparency, security, and fairness. This system is aimed at enabling individuals and groups to gather financial support for projects, ideas, and causes directly from the community.

## Future Scope
1. **Adding Token Support**: Integrate ERC20 tokens to allow contributions in tokens, expanding the platform's flexibility.
2. **Campaign Verification**: Implement a system for verifying campaigns to ensure legitimacy and increase trust among contributors.
3. **Campaign Rewards**: Allow campaign creators to offer rewards to contributors based on their contribution amount.
4. **Milestone Funding**: Add functionality to release funds incrementally based on achieving specific milestones during the campaign.
5. **Community Voting**: Introduce a feature for the community to vote on whether a campaign should proceed or not based on its progress.

## Key Features
1. **Campaign Creation**: The campaign owner can create a crowdfunding campaign by specifying the funding goal and duration.
2. **Contributions**: Anyone can contribute to a campaign until the goal is met or the campaign ends.
3. **Refunds**: If the campaign doesn't reach its goal, contributors can claim refunds after the campaign deadline.
4. **Campaign Status**: The owner can end the campaign once the deadline is reached, transferring the funds if the goal is met.
5. **Security**: The contract includes protections such as re-entrancy prevention and checks for valid contributions.
